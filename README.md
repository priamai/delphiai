# Delphi AI
Using GPT models to predict future events.
Inspired on the initial work of Prof. Scott Cunningham.
Original article [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07396).

# What is this project

We want to constantly predict future high profile events and track how the various LLM/GPT models change their predictions based on the current state of the internet.

We want to then retrospectively assess the quality of such predictions as the prediction horizon terminates or the event is realised.

# Categories

We focus on the following categories for now:
* geo-political events
* awards from multiple fields such as Nobel Prize, BAFTA, OSCARS 
* macro economic factors

# Repository

The folder with events contains the list of events we are tracking.
